The skin peels off your fingers as you pull on the cables, blister in the war-time breeze 

You're spending all your money finding facts in fables, you pick and choose what you please 

Bring the butcher to the belly of the belly of the beast
So he can slice at the roots of the roots of the disease
Bring some ID please

You cut a solitary figure when you're holding all the knives, 
patience is a virtue if you've never had to try
There's something in the water and it gurgles down below, a sea creature or submarine but something's in the know
I'm in over my head
   
For a minute I saw the end

Shirts and ties and a fuck load of wire living in the back of the car

A freelance dream did you let in the right one, does anyone know what you are? 

Bring the cheap wine to the billionaires feast

And watch the blood discolour their teeth
The meat is all guilt free
